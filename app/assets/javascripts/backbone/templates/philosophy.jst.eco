          Our menu is 100% based on seasonally available and organic ingredients and is
          changing constantly.  If you care about where your food comes from, we may be the
          caterer for you.

      <h2 class="page-section-title">Benefits</h2>
      <div class="page-section-body">
        <p>
          When we shop, cook, and eat seasonally we do a number of great things.  First, we
          support our local farms and ranches who bring food  to our tables.  Second, we ensure
          we are getting products at the best version of themselves and simultaneously at their
          best values.  We keep a perfect Oregon strawberry exactly where it belongs; signifying
          the beginning of summer, where it makes the biggest impact on our minds and palates.
          In the dead of winter, we would serve a perfect pomegranate or quince instead.

      <div class="page-section-body">
        <p>
          Sustainability in a time of enlightenment should be important to us all.  At BANGARANG
          we strive to utilize whole products while composting the unusable portions.  We
          purchase from low impact purveyors and recycle everything possible.  In doing this, we
          have adopted a “no disposables” policy. We have seen firsthand the exorbitant amount
          of waste that takes place in the restaurant industry and this is an area we can all make
          an impact in while helping to keep our beautiful Central Oregon the place we have come
          to love.

        <p>
          Experience has taught us that certain foods adapt well to catered events while others do
          not.  We center our menu around foods that hold presentation and flavors well.  We strive
          to put forth entrees that will be as delicious at your event as they were the day of your
          tasting.
